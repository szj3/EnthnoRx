# EthnoRx
A digital application that bridges western medicine to naturopathic medicine by launching a program to monitor patients with chronic conditions.. 

The app is designed to cater to a specific cohort of patients diagnosed with critical diseases like COPD or high blood pressure who have disclosed their use of herbal medications to manage their symptoms. Its purpose is to closely monitor these patients, engaging with them to understand their herbal treatment regimen, dosage, symptom management, and optionally, to facilitate discussions with their doctors regarding alternative medication options. By offering doctors a comprehensive understanding of ethno-medications, the app empowers them to make informed decisions about their patients' treatments. Moreover, it encourages active participation from patients in managing their health choices, thereby promoting overall well-being. The overarching goal of the app is to prioritize education and understanding of medical options, fostering informed decision-making rather than imposing medical practices onto individuals.

## Target Users & Personas
Firstly, it addresses the needs of patients diagnosed with critical illnesses such as COPD or high blood pressure, who have opted for herbal remedies alongside traditional medication. These patients seek a platform to monitor the efficacy of their herbal treatments and maintain open communication with their healthcare providers regarding any changes in symptom management. Additionally, the app targets patients eager to expand their knowledge about herbal remedies, including their uses, effects, and potential interactions. On the physician side, the app serves as a valuable tool for healthcare professionals who work with patients incorporating herbal remedies into their treatment plans. It equips physicians with the necessary resources to closely monitor their patients' symptoms and deliver optimal healthcare. Moreover, the app caters to physicians interested in enhancing their understanding of ethno-medications, providing insights into the uses and effects of various herbal remedies, ultimately enabling them to offer well-informed guidance to their patients.
